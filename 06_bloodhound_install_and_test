1. Requires java

3. Need to download new release of bloodhound

4. After install you need a collector either on a compromised Device or bloodhound.py running on linux.

5. This is the script I ran that collects all the information the collector can get (collection mode set to all)
```script 
	bloodhound-python  -u {username}  -p {password} -dc dc1.xyz.com --disable-autogc -d xyz.com -c all
```
